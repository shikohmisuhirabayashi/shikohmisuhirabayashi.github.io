<p>I recently graduated from Harvard with a double major in Neuroscience and Physics and a minor in Economics. I conducted research at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Center for Brain Science, and the Technology & Operations Management Unit @Harvard Business School.<p>

<p>Outside of the classroom, I served as Student Body Co-President and Class Marshal, and co-founded student organizations focused on aging, AR/VR, and emerging technologies.<p>
